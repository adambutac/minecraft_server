There will be two items and they must be #LEGENDARY
They have to look super legit.
One will be based around constructing healing and other forms of positiveness.
One will be based on destruction death fire and all other fun things.
These items will need a self destruct function that can be triggered remotely.

Spellbooks
    Must be rare as fuck.
    The player can read the spellbook to semipermenantly learn a spell.
    Players will need to map hotkeys.(r,f,and c will be recommended)
    Players will be able to replace old spells with new ones.
    Players will not be able to learn a spell more than once.(map the same spell to different 
    keys)
