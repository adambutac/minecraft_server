# minecraft_server
Hello,

    This is one of the larger projects I have worked on.
  
    Unfortunately, it is simply a set of modifications for the indie game "Minecraft" using an open source project called "Forge." 

    There are two files I would like to point out as "most important."

        SuperMod.java

            This is the main java class that I currently use on my server and is completely server side code.

        phobos/Phobos.java

            This is a set of "cheats" I found that works completely on the client side.

    Other works here are "legacy" from when I first started modding Minecraft.
